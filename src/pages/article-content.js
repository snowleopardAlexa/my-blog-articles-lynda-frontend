        `Welcome! Today we're going to be talking about how to learn React. The
        key is to read the documentation and make some notes, but before you do it,
        make sure you are a quite familiar with Javascript. You don't need to be
        excellent at it, but you need to have a good understanding of this scripting language.
        Secondly, I want you to focus on the terms which you don't understand. If you
        encounter a word or the term which is weird to you, search the dictionary, make sure
        you are searching for the tech terminology, take notes and memorize the term if you can.`
